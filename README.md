Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The additional resources I used were: MDN Web Docs, DayJs, Google fonts, and Bootstrap.
